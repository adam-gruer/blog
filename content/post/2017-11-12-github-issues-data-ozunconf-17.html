<p>What a great two days I had at rOpenSci’s <a href="http://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/">ozunconf 2017</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>two days of meeting fascinating and friendly new people</li>
<li>two days filled with great conversations</li>
<li>two days of learning new things and breaking things</li>
<li>two days of inspiration</li>
<li>two days of communal git ups and downs</li>
<li>two days of not having to explain ‘why R’</li>
</ul>
<p>Before, during and since the ozunconf I have been the interested in the idea that since actions create data - our own actions in attending and participating generate their own data that would be interesting to analyse.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll attempt to provide some analysis of the github issues that were used as the springboard for discussions and projects at the conference and beyond.</p>

<h2>Getting the data from the GitHub GraphQL API</h2>
<p>Before the conference, participants were given the option of creating issues for possible selection as projects during the conference and aftwerwards. There were a <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf17/issues">lot of great ideas</a> and discussion in the comments on each issue. Github offers several API for getting data about a repo and its issues. I am attempting to use <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/">Github’s GraphQL API</a>, which is an emerging <a href="http://graphql.org/">data query language</a> being used for API by services such as Github, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.</p>

<h3>Load some packages</h3>
<pre class="r"><code># devtools::install_github(&quot;ropensci/ghql&quot;)
library(&quot;ghql&quot;)  # creates a graphql client 
library(&quot;jsonlite&quot;) # helps parse JSON
library(&quot;httr&quot;) # for making web requests and getting the reponse
library(dplyr)  # data wrangling and pipes %&gt;%
library(purrr) # there will be a lot of map / reducing with the returned data</code></pre>
