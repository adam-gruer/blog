This a short post demonstrating how to link to another post from the .Rmd source
of a separate post.

The directory of blog project looks a bit like this on my computer.
<figure>
<pre>
blog
|   .gitignore
|   .Rhistory
|   blog.Rproj
|   config.toml
|   index.Rmd
|   README.md
|   
+---archetypes
+---content
|   +---home
|   |       about.md
|   |       hero.md
|   |       posts.md
|   |       tags.md
|   |       
|   +---post
|   |       2018-06-01-guards-guards-purrr-map-if.html
|   |       2018-06-01-guards-guards-purrr-map-if.Rmd
|   |       2018-06-28-linking-to-other-post-in-a-blogdown-app.html

Each .Rmd source file in your content/post folder has some YAML markup that will
look something like this

<code class="language-YAML">

The slug is the important thing for links.
The slug in the YAML of my file
<code>2018-06-01-guards-guards-purrr-map-if.Rmd</code> is
<code>guards-guards-purrr-map-if</code> .  If I ant to link to it from this post
I can use a relative link of <code>/post/slug</code>, so in this instance 
<code class="language-html">&lt;a href="/post/guards-guards-purrr-map-if">&lt;/a>
</code> <a href="/post/guards-guards-purrr-map-if">Guards! Guards!</a>
In oyur blog project on your computer, you treat the content folder as the root
of your blog when it is published so all folder/slug paths should be relative
to that.  Guaranteed, works on my computer.

IN a code chunk I think you can use
```{r}
blogdown::shortcode_html("relref", "post/guards-guards-purrr-map-if")

```
