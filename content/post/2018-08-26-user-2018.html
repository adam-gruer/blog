<p><strong>tldr: I haven’t completed this post yet its WIP - I’ll tweet when it’s done.</strong></p>
<p>it’s taken a long time to write about my experience at user!2018 in Brisbane. Partly , i was having some problems with my blog not building on Netlify that I couldnt resolve. also i fell into a bit of a post conference funk.</p>
