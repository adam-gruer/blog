**tldr: I haven't completed this post yet its WIP - I'll tweet when it's done.**

it's taken a long time to write about my experience  at user!2018 in Brisbane.
Partly , i was having some problems with my blog not building on Netlify that I
couldnt resolve. also i fell into a bit of a post conference funk.
