I found a cool use for purrr's `map_if` function recently that both felt wizardly and helped me better understand when to use `map-if`.
Problem: I had a list called `params` ` with 3 items of different types

- start_date - a Date 
- end_date - a Date
- confidence_interval - a Numeric

```{r create the list}
params <-  list(
                start_date = as.Date("2015-01-01"),
                end_date = as.Date("2015-12-31"),
                confidence_interval = 0.8
                )
params
```

I wanted to convert this to a list where the two dates were formatted as characters in the format *01 January 2015* and the confidence_interval left as is. So, if the item was a date I wanted to apply the `format` function to it and if not a date do nothing to the item.

Iterating over a list and applying a function? I knew I would want to use the `purrr` package.

I just needed to find a function to only do something if the item passed some test.

Enter `purrr::map_if()`
`map_if` takes the list or vector you want to iterate over (a list in my case), a predicate function(?) and the function you want to apply to elements of the list.

Back to the predicate function. Predicate is a word that hurts my head. I like to think of it as a guard function. Each element in the list gets passed to the guard function and it should return `TRUE` or `FALSE`, if an element passes the guard (`TRUE`) it gets passed to your main function. If an element doesn't pass the guard


```{r test for date and format}
library(purrr)
library(lubridate)
params %>%
  map_if(is.Date, format, format = "%d %B %Y")

```
```{r test for date and format}
library(purrr)
library(lubridate)
params %>%
  map_at(c("start_at", "end_at"), format, format = "%d %B %Y")

params %>%
  map_at(c(1,3), format, format = "%d %B %Y")

```
